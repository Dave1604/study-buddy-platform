# Study Buddy

## Lesson Duration Tracking

This application now supports recording lesson video duration and displaying totals.

### Backend

- Endpoint: `PUT /api/courses/:courseId/lessons/:lessonId/duration`
  - Auth: instructor or admin
  - Body: `{ durationSeconds: number }` (preferred) or `{ durationMinutes: number }`
  - Stores lesson `duration` in minutes on the `Course` model.

### Frontend

- `CourseDetail` shows per-lesson duration and a computed course total.
- Service method: `courseService.updateLessonDuration(courseId, lessonId, { durationSeconds })`.

### Suggested Workflow

1. Instructor creates/edits a lesson with a video URL.
2. After metadata is known, call the duration endpoint to persist it.
3. Learners see lesson badges (e.g., “12m”) and course total time (e.g., “3h 5m”).

## Recent Changes & Admin Guide

- Admin Dashboard is the single hub for admins; admins are redirected from `/dashboard` to `/admin`.
- Navbar: Admin no longer sees the `Courses` link. Instructors see their own courses only on the `Courses` page.
- Lesson durations: YouTube duration capture saves minutes per lesson and updates course totals automatically.
- Video unavailable handling: Lessons show an inline alert if a YouTube video is unavailable.
- Audit report download: As an admin, go to Admin → "Generate Report" to download a JSON audit of courses with:
  - total minutes per course and formatted time
  - flags for totals outside ~6h (±1h)
  - missing/invalid video URLs
- System Settings (Admin → System Settings): manage site name, support email, maintenance mode, registrations, and theme color. Changes persist via secure backend endpoints.

### Endpoints added
- `GET /api/courses/audit` (admin, instructor view wired via button for admins)
- `GET /api/system/settings` (admin)
- `PUT /api/system/settings` (admin)
